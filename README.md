This project addresses the challenge of determining the shortest distance between two locations, particularly in emergency scenarios where time is critical. To tackle this issue, the project proposes a solution that leverages graph data structure techniques and visualization tools to identify the optimal and most efficient path between two given locations. By employing these methods, the project aims to simplify the process of finding the shortest distance and provide a practical approach for emergency situations.

Includes concept of Graph, dijkstra's Algorithm.
